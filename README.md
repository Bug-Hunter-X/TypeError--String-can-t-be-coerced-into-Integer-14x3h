# Ruby Type Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common type error in Ruby where an arithmetic operation is performed on a string.  The `bug.rb` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to add an integer to a string. The `bugSolution.rb` file provides a solution to the error.  The error arises because Ruby does not automatically convert strings to numbers during arithmetic operations.  This example highlights the importance of type checking and handling potential type errors in your code.
